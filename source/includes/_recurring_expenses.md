## Get Recurring Expenses

Use this endpoint to retrieve a list of recurring expenses to expect for a specified period.

Every month, a different set of recurring expenses is expected. This is because recurring expenses can be once a year, twice a year, every 4 months, etc.

If a recurring expense is listed as “twice a month”, then that recurring expense will be returned twice, each with a different billing date based on when the system believes that recurring expense transaction is to be expected. If the recurring expense is listed as “once a week”, then that recurring expense will be returned in this list as many times as there are weeks for the specified month.

In the same vein, if a recurring expense that began last month is set to “Every 3 months”, then that recurring expense will not show up in the results for this month.
