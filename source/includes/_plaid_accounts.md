Plaid Accounts are individual bank accounts that you have linked to Lunch Money via Plaid. You may link one bank but one bank might contain 4 accounts. Each of these accounts is a Plaid Account.

### HTTP Request

`GET https://dev.lunchmoney.app/v1/plaid_accounts`

## Trigger Fetch from Plaid

_This is an experimental endpoint and parameters and/or response may change._

Use this endpoint to trigger a fetch for latest data from Plaid.

> Example 200 Response

```json
true
```

Returns true if there were eligible Plaid accounts to trigger a fetch for. Eligible accounts are those who `last_fetch` value is over 1 minute ago. (Although the limit is every minute, please use this endpoint sparingly!)

Note that fetching from Plaid is a background job. This endpoint simply queues up the job. You may track the `plaid_last_successful_update`, `last_fetch` and `last_import` properties to verify the results of the fetch.
