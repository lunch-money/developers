# Current Status

The developer API (v1) is in open public beta and will not progress to a generally available state. We recommend that new users start their projects on the [v2 API](https://alpha.lunchmoney.dev/v2/docs), which is in open alpha and actively maintained. The v2 API is expected to progress to general availability (GA) in early 2026.

If you are an existing API user, we encourage you to review the [v2 migration guide](https://alpha.lunchmoney.dev/v2/migration-guide) to help plan your migration.

Please use this API at your own risk as and be aware that changes made to your data via the API are irreversible.


We invite you to [join the Lunch Money community on Discord](https://lunchmoney.app/discord) and provide feedback in the [Developer API Channel](https://discord.com/channels/842337014556262411/1134594318414389258).

We also welcome general feedback via email [support@lunchmoney.app](mailto:support@lunchmoney.app). 

You can find these docs [on Github](https://github.com/lunch-money/developers), so if you see a mistake or something that could be improved, feel free to open a pull request!
